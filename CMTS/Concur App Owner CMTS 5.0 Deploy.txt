Abby,

Thanks again for making the time to perform UAT/TRR government testing today.  Please provide your 
concurrence to successfully testing CMTS in our SEF Test Staging environment. Please reply to all with 
your concurrence.


Deandrea,

Once Abby provides her concurrence to testing CMTS, please provide your concurrence to deploy CMTS, 
which is current scheduled for next Friday June 19th.




Thank you for the support,
