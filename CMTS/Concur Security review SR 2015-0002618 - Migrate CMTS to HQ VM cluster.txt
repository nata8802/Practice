> Hello all,
> 
> ITCD created SR 2015-0002618 to manage the migration of the CMTS applications from WESTPrime 
into the HQ VM cluster. This SR is the first in a series seeking to migrate HQ applications back from the 
WESTPrime environment.
> 
> HITSS Security, in collaboration with HITSS Application Development, performed an abbreviated 
review of the proposed release of the application, which was relatively unchanged from it’s current 
production state, including a manual review of all proposed code changes (full report attached). 
> 
> HITSS Security has identified no issues of note, and believes the overall risk associated with the SR to 
be low. HITSS Security recommends that ITCD proceed as normal.
